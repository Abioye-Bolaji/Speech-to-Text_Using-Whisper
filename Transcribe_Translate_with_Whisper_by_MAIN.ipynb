        "# Instructions for Using this Speech-to-Text Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provides a simple way to transcribe audio files to text using the Whisper model by OpenAI. It supports batch processing, various output formats, and can be run locally or in Google Colab.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Features:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Transcription:** Converts speech in audio files into written text.\n",
        "* **Batch Processing:** Enables processing of multiple audio files or long audio files split into chunks.\n",
        "* **Output Formats:** Supports various output formats like TXT, VTT, and SRT.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Running in Google Colab\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Install Dependencies:** Run the provided code cell to install the required libraries.\n",
        "2. **Upload Audio:** Upload your audio file(s) to the \"Files\" section in the Colab sidebar. For batch processing or long files, first split your audio into smaller chunks (around 10 minutes each) using the provided code cells.\n",
        "3. **Configure Transcription:**\n",
        "    * In the \"Transcribe or Translate Recorded Audio\" code cell, edit the `audio_file` path to match your uploaded file name or folder path.\n",
        "    * Select your desired `use_model` (e.g., \"tiny\", \"base\", \"medium\").\n",
        "    * Optionally, adjust other parameters like `language` and `prompt` as needed.\n",
        "4. **Run Transcription:** Execute the \"Transcribe or Translate Recorded Audio\" code cell.\n",
        "5. **Save Results:** Run the \"Save results for recorded audio\" code cell to save transcriptions in your chosen output formats (TXT, VTT, SRT) to the designated folder.\n",
        "6. **Optional: Translate with DeepL:** If you have a DeepL API key, you can translate the transcriptions using the provided code cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Running Locally\n",
        "\n",
        "To use this code locally with an IDE (like VS Code, PyCharm), follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Create a Project:** Create a new project in your IDE.\n",
        "2. **Install Libraries:** Install the necessary libraries listed in the \"Step 1\" section using `pip`:\n",
        "3. **Download Code:** Copy the code from this Colab notebook and paste it into a Python file in your project (e.g., `audio_to_text.py`).\n",
        "4. **Adapt Code:**\n",
        "   * Update file paths for audio input and output to match your local setup.\n",
        "   * Remove or comment out the Colab-specific parts of the code (e.g., `google.colab` imports, `eval_js` calls).\n",
        "   * Consider streamlining the code by removing unused sections, such as the DeepL translation parts.  \n",
        "5. **Execute:** Run your Python file (`audio_to_text.py`) from your IDE's terminal or by using the IDE's run functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Important Notes\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Dependency Versions:** Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for the specific dependency versions used during development. Different versions may lead to unexpected behavior.\n",
        "* **Long Audio Files:** For optimal results with long audio files, use the provided code cells to split them into smaller chunks before transcription.\n",
        "* **Prompting:** You can use the `prompt` parameter to provide context to the Whisper model and encourage a specific writing style.\n",
        "* **DeepL Translation:** To use DeepL translation, you'll need a DeepL API key.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**\n",
        "\n",
        "This code was developed using specific dependency versions, and the Whisper model was not trained. Different versions or models may lead to varying results. Also the translation functionality using DeepL has been removed for this version."
